# RPi Ibex (Hyperpixel edition)

RPi Ibex is a Raspberry Pi Zero based portable computer. The goal of the project is to provide a way to use Raspberry Pi Zero as a portable computer using parts that are available, cheap and relatively easy to solder (no exotic keyboard controller chips required). 

This repository contains Kicad project files for the PCB. The keyboard is just simple push buttons soldered directly on the board. The keyboard controller is an Atmega 328P.
